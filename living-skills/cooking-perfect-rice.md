# Basic Cooking: How to Cook Perfect Rice

**Category**: Cooking
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Time Required**: 25-30 minutes

## What You'll Need

- 1 cup of rice (white or brown)
- 2 cups of water (for white rice) or 2.5 cups (for brown rice)
- Pot with lid
- Optional: pinch of salt, 1 tsp of oil/butter

## Steps

1. **Rinse the Rice**
   - Place rice in a bowl
   - Cover with cold water
   - Swirl with your hand and drain
   - Repeat 2-3 times until water runs clear
   - This removes excess starch

2. **Measure Water**
   - Use 2:1 water-to-rice ratio for white rice
   - Use 2.5:1 for brown rice
   - Add a pinch of salt if desired

3. **Bring to Boil**
   - Place rice and water in pot
   - Bring to a boil over high heat
   - Don't cover yet

4. **Simmer**
   - Once boiling, reduce heat to low
   - Cover with lid
   - Simmer for 18 minutes (white) or 45 minutes (brown)
   - Don't lift the lid!

5. **Rest**
   - Turn off heat
   - Let sit covered for 5-10 minutes
   - This allows steam to finish cooking

6. **Fluff and Serve**
   - Remove lid
   - Fluff with a fork
   - Serve immediately

## Tips & Tricks

- The finger method: Water should reach your first knuckle when you touch the rice
- Add a bay leaf or cardamom for flavor
- Use chicken/vegetable broth instead of water for more flavor
- Leftover rice is perfect for fried rice the next day

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Don't skip rinsing - this prevents sticky, gummy rice
- Don't lift the lid while cooking - you'll release steam
- Don't stir while cooking - this makes rice mushy
- Use the right pot size - too big and water evaporates too fast

## Variations to Try

- Add frozen peas and carrots for vegetable rice
- Mix in coconut milk for coconut rice
- Toast rice in oil before adding water for nuttier flavor
